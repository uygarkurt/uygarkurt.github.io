        <p><strong>About the Author: </strong>W. Somerset Maugham was born in 1874 in Paris. He was orphaned at ten, raised and educated by his uncle. He was shy and withdrawn during his school days. Maugham became a medical student in London and qualified as a physician in 1897. Instead of practicing medicine, he became a full-time writer. He's known for his plays, novels, and short stories. During WWI, he worked as a secret agent. In 1938, he visited Hindu sage Ramana Maharishi and used him as the model for the yogi character in his last major novel, The Razor's Edge. Maugham found writing The Razor's Edge unusually tiring. He completed the novel in 1944 when he was 70 years old. Maugham died at the age of 91 in 1965.</p>

        <p><strong>About the Time Book Was Written: </strong>Published in 1944. Events in the book start to take place in 1922 and continue throughout the characters' lifetime. The author did a great job conveying the people, the way of living, the differences, and how they changed over time. You can see the class differences among people. As time passes, you can observe the appearance of the middle class and how the upper class resists and feels irritated by it. The author also observes how the different nations see each other worldwide.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Summary and Thoughts: </strong>This is my first-ever book by William Somerset Maugham. He has a, I'm going to say, 'fluffy' writing style. Sentences are very sophisticated, even though they convey a straightforward idea.</p>

        <p>We have our main character, Larry, a fighter pilot traumatized by his experiences in war. Instead of a regular pathway, such as finding a job, getting married, and providing for your home, he chases his spiritual growth. Along the way, he hopes to find God. On the other hand, some characters pursue just the opposite. We observe them through the eyes of their friend. From time to time, they see each other after years.</p>

        <p>The main feeling the book left on me is that there's no final point. We don't get to know what characters are feeling, what they do, what they would do differently in the end. This perfectly aligns with the fact that the narrator is a character in the book. This ending is also usually like how our relationships are like with each other in real life. After a point, we have no idea.</p>

        <p><strong>3 Lessons</strong></p>
        
        <p><strong>Lesson 1: Things Change.</strong></p>

        <p>Throughout the book, we observe change. Change of people, of the society, change of the closest people. It's a fact of nature and doesn't exclude human character. Kings can become peasants; peasants can become kings. Once Elliot gets older and less influential, people stop to care about him. Gray, once prosperous, loses everything in the market crash. Borders between social classes get thinner. An ordinary taxi driver addresses Elliot as "brother," which bothers him. But that's the fact. Things change.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Lesson 2: There's No Correct Way of Living.</strong></p>

        <p>Larry decides to "loaf." Elliot decides to "entertain" people. Isabelle wants to live distinguished. We may judge, despise, or argue about them. There's no right or wrong to this. Just wants and choices. However, there are consequences. We observe that materially ambitious people like Gray get older quickly. Gets sick faster. On the other hand, Larry, a spiritually developed character, stays young and out of stress. This is a choice, either.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Lesson 3: More Knowledge Doesn't Mean More Wisdom.</strong></p>

        <p>In search of spiritual growth, Larry religiously reads and learns. He learns different philosophies and reads various text pieces. Nevertheless, he's not content. Only when he gets out, meet people, experience, and feel in specific ways he starts to grasp wisdom.</p>

        <p><strong>5 Influential Quotes and My Interpretations</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Quote 1: </strong>"If you will act as if you believed, belief will be granted to you."</p>
        <p>You must believe you're. You must achieve that identity level change first. The king comes first. The kingdom afterward. Not the other way around.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Quote 2: </strong>"He wants to work, he feels he ought to, and it humiliates him not to be wanted."</p>
        <p>We chase success; we have goals. However, that's not what we're after. We want to be seen and feel important.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Quote 3: </strong>"After all, if you want to know something the best way is to ask."</p>
        <p>How simple it can be? If you want to find something, seek. If you want to know, ask.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Quote 4: </strong>"Men have always wanted a personal God to whom they can turn in distress for comfort and encouragement."</p>
        <p>People don't usually even think about God. Apart from asking and fearing when they're in need.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Quote 5: </strong>"My mind is free when I'm washing a car or tinkering with a carburettor and when the job's done I have the pleasant sensation of having accomplished something."</p>
        <p>To achieve a feeling of fulfillment is as easy as this. With small things, we can feel this sensation. Chop wood. Carry water.</p>
