        <p><strong>About the Author: </strong>Oscar Wilde was born in 1854 in Dublin. He became associated with aestheticism, which is an art movement that advocates "art for art's sake." In 1890, he published his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray. Wilde remarked, “Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry is what the world thinks me; Dorian is what I would like to be—in other ages, perhaps.” In the context of the characters of the book. It was a controversial book of the time. Criticized for its perceived immorality and decadence. Wilde argued, "There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all." He was sentenced to two years of hard labor due to "gross indecency." He was released from prison in poor health and lived the rest of his life in exile in France. He died in 1900 due to poor health.</p>

        <p><strong>About the Time Book Was Written: </strong>Published in 1890, this book is a bold critique of Victorian society and its values. Victorian England placed great emphasis on proprietary, duty, wealth, and appearance. In this novel, Wilde demonstrates how the members of such a society can have a double life. As Dorian, a member of such a society, lives in wealth and with many virtues. However, his true nature is wicked. Wilde critiques the period's gender roles and includes subtle homoerotic hints, such as between Basil and Dorian, which was ultimately controversial at the time.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Summary and Thoughts: </strong>The story follows Dorian Gray, a young and extraordinarily beautiful man, who becomes the subject of a portrait by the artist Basil Hallward. Basil is infatuated with Dorian’s beauty, considering him his artistic muse. Through Basil, Dorian meets Lord Henry, an aristocrat who espouses a philosophy of hedonism, encouraging Dorian to pursue pleasure and youth above all else. With this encounter, the moral tug-of-war between good and evil starts. Basil Hallward represents good and virtue, whereas Lord Henry represents evil, vice, and hedonistic ideals.</p>

        <p>Basil paints a portrait of Dorian Gray. Under Lord Henry's influence, Dorian wishes that his portrait would age in his place. His wish is granted. Instead of him, his portrait bears his decay.</p>

        <p>Dorian falls in love with the actress Sibyl Vane. Initially, Dorian falls for Sibyl because she embodies an ideal of artistic and aesthetic beauty. He admires her as a performer rather than as a person, treating her as an object of his imagination. Revealing his shallow obsession with appearances over substance. Dorian invites his friends Basil and Henry to see one of her plays. In this play, Sibyl acts horribly on purpose. This fractures Dorian's image of Sibyl, and he rejects her cruelly. She commits suicide. After a brief remorse after the suicide, Dorian is influenced by Lord Henry’s hedonistic philosophy to see the tragedy as an artistic and dramatic event. This event marks Dorian's plunge into corruption and guilt.</p>

        <p>From this point forward, he chooses to pursue a life of selfish pleasure and excess, fully embracing the decay of his character while remaining physically untouched by it. This event also marks the first visible change in Dorian’s enchanted portrait, which begins to reflect the corruption of his soul.</p>

        <p>As Dorian descends into a life of debauchery and cruelty, the changes in the portrait torment him. His actions lead to the deaths of several people, including Basil, whom Dorian murders in a fit of rage. He tries to confess this to Lord Henry since he has a dismissive attitude toward morality and consequences, which provides a safe outlet for Dorian’s guilt. However, Dorian couldn't find the outlet he desired. This further pushes Dorian into despair.</p>

        <p>Unable to bear the sight of the portrait, Dorian tries to destroy it, but in doing so, he fatally wounds himself. In the end, Dorian’s body is found aged and withered, while the portrait is restored to its original beauty.</p>

        <p><strong>3 Lessons</strong></p>
        
        <p><strong>Lesson 1: The Corrupting Power of Influence.</strong></p>

        <p>At the start of the book, Dorian is naive and gay. However, Lord Henry’s hedonistic philosophy profoundly influences Dorian, steering him down a path of moral decay. This illustrates the dangers of allowing others to dictate our values and decisions. Doesn't matter how good or bad an idea or influence seems, one must be skeptical. Compare with the values of himself/herself.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Lesson 2: The Inescapability of Consequences.</strong></p>

        <p>From the outside, the consequences of your actions may be invisible. You can lie to yourself. Even there may be a portrait to bear of the consequences of your actions, such as the portrait of Dorian. However, the consequences of your actions catch you. Morally or physically. Morally, such as the downfall of Dorian. Physically, such as the attempted revenge of James Vane over her sister.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Lesson 3: Appearance Can Be Deceiving.</strong></p>

        <p>The sad reality of people. Judgments are made based on appearance. A person may appear to embody numerous virtues, such as the Dorian. Or, on the contrary, may appear to embody various vices. A person may be full of joy and cheer. But he/she may be going through dreadful inner turmoils. This may give a pre-judgment about the person. But this judgment doesn't have to be true.</p>

        <p><strong>5 Influential Quotes and My Interpretations</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Quote 1: </strong>"But the bravest man among us is afraid of himself."</p>
        <p>The real challenge one faces is not external but it's within. By looking inward and facing who we truly are.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Quote 2: </strong>"There is a luxury in self-reproach. When we blame ourselves, we feel that no one else has a right to blame us."</p>
        <p>By blaming oneself, one can take control of the act of blaming. Now, we can shield ourselves from the judgment of others. There's nothing to judge if we've judged ourselves already.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Quote 3: </strong>"A strange sense of loss came over him. He felt that Dorian Gray would never again be to him all that he had been in the past. Life had come between them..."</p>
        <p>Everything changes, including people. And a sense of mourning lingers.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Quote 4: </strong>""I didn’t say I liked it. I said it fascinated me. There is a great difference."</p>
        <p>There's a thin line between liking and fascination. Fascination implies intrigue, curiosity, even obsession. There may be a darker hint of fascination.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Quote 5: </strong>"The reason I will not exhibit this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of my own soul."</p>
        <p>There's a fear of vulnerability in self-reveal. Creative expression can inadvertently expose the deepest truths and emotions of the creator, revealing aspects of the self that are intensely private.</p>
