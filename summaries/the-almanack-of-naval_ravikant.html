        <p><strong>About the Author: </strong>Even though this book is about Naval Ravikant, it was not written by him. His ideas from several resources are gathered, such as his Twitter, podcasts, and essays, and put together in this book in an organized manner by Eric Jorgenson. Still, let’s give some information about the book’s main character, Naval Ravikant.</p>

        <p>Naval Ravikant is an entrepreneur and investor. He was born in New Delhi, India, in 1974. He and his family moved to New York when he was 9. Starting from his childhood, Naval had a keen interest in reading. He went to the library after school. While 15, he worked at an illegal catering company. He enrolled in Stuyvesant, which he puts as "That saved my life because once I had the Stuyvesant brand, I got into an Ivy League college, which led me into tech." He studied economics and computer science at Dartmouth. At 22, he worked at "@Home Network" where he told everyone he was there temporarily and started his own company. At 25, he founded his first company, "Epinions" and continued his career as an investor and entrepreneur.</p>
        
        <p><strong>About the Time Book Was Written: </strong>Published in 2020, I’ll assume it was written when Naval was around 45. The book contains his experiences up to that time, including numerous startups, investments, and life events starting from 1974. These are relevant dates, and many of the lessons apply today.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Summary and Thoughts: </strong>This is both a motivational and enlightening book. It’s motivational because it’s a story of someone who started from the ground and reached (as close as possible) his ideals. In this case, these ideals were "three big ones" as Naval puts it: wealth, health, and happiness, with a remark that their importance is in reverse. They may differ for someone else. However, the same principles apply. 

        <p>It’s enlightening because he could observe his experiences, feelings, and thoughts throughout the process. He shows them with actual events and maxims. I would say it’s even a bit philosophical. Furthermore, he synthesized what he did right and wrong and what to expect if you take a journey to your ideals. In this case, his principal ideals were wealth, health, happiness, etc. So, one part of the book is about wealth, and the second is about happiness. We end up with a fine blend of wisdom about wealth and happiness.</p>

        <p><strong>3 Lessons</strong></p>
        
        <p><strong>Lesson 1: All the Returns in Life Comes From Compound Interest.</strong></p>

        <p>In Naval’s words, "All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest." In financial terms, it’s when you get interest of your interest. It grows exponentially. This same concept can be applied to any return in life. It applies to relationships. The longer you’re with someone, the more you trust them. It applies to your reputation. The longer you show high-integrity behavior, the more people will trust you. The more you work on something, the more you’ll start to improve exponentially at some point. That’s the concept.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Lesson 2: Money Solves Your Money Problems. That’s it.</strong></p>

        <p>It can’t solve your health problems. It can’t make your relationships great. It may resolve some impediments along the way. However, it’s not a potion that can solve everything, especially for happiness. It may have the contrary effect if you’re very keen about it. You become a more competitive and anxious person. It’s a bottomless pit. There’s always more to earn. You never become happy until you possess it. The same applies to any such obsessive desire. Naval puts it as "Every desire Is a chosen unhappiness." You’ll have desires. However, with this realization, you can control its effects.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Lesson 3: Happiness Is Learned. Happiness Is a Choice.</strong></p>

        <p>Happiness is different for everyone. For Naval, "Happiness is the state when nothing is missing." When you’re free of the "I need this and that" web of desires. When you’re content. We defined what happiness is (for Naval, at least). How do we work on it? Naval gives some tips. Not judging people, carefully selecting people in your life, exercising, not envying, sitting quietly in a room. Most importantly, you choose to be happy. Accept yourself and be content. Not by the standards of society but by being who you are.</p>
